# CryptoZombie
With CryptoZombies, you'll learn how to write Ethereum Smart Contracts using Solidity in a fun, interactive manner where i get to code our own zombie game.

The interactive nature of CryptoZombies makes it super simple to learn DApp development in a step-by-step manner that gradually increases in difficulty.

ERC721x Multi-Fungible Tokens.
Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) like ERC721, every item is totally 100% unique. Multi-Fungible Tokens recognize that in most games, allowing us  to have multiple identical copies of the same item.

For example, your Master Sword is probably exactly the same as my Master Sword — they look the same, do the same damage, and have the exact same functionality. Thus we would call these items "fungible", because we could trade our Master Swords without either one of us minding — there is no difference between them.

Of course, this isn't always the case. For some items, maybe we do want them to be one of a kind.

Thus, ERC721x gives you the flexibility to do both — and to manage all the items in your game, both fungible and non-fungible, within one single smart contract. And best of all, it's fully backward-compatible with ERC721.
